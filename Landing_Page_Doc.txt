Purpose:

The purpose of this event landing page was to give people information on the Osheaga 2024 event, a very popular music and art festival which attracts young people from around the world, and hopefully entice them to buy some tickets.
The event takes place over several days, so my page shows users the schedule for each day of the event.
I also displayed the full list of artists separately from the schedule so people could look at the list of artists in an easier way than looking at the schedule.
The landing page gives a brief description of the event and shows the event location as well as a promotional video for the event.
As mentioned the goal of the website is to entice the user to get tickets, so I made a registration page where I mimic buying tickets for the event.
That being said I did not use any javascript and thus did not display the price or proper input validation, only regex pattern attributes in the html elements.

Extra info:

The landing page and schedule page have links to the tickets page embedded in advertising elements.
The schedule pictures are clickable and bring the user to a page with only the schedule so the user can better see the schedule.
There is a feedback page for the user to submit a message to the event organizers.
All pages are fully resizable for all pixel widths and I accomplish this by using percentages for widths and height as well as media queries which change elements from flex-row to flex-column and add/subtract margin/padding;
Every page on the website can be translated to french.

Copyright:

For this website I used media content from the official Osheaga page, many other websites have used their images and videos so I believe these are free to use for the public.
I also used the google maps embed a link feature to embed the event location.
Lastly I used svgrepo.com to get the icons for the payment methods.
